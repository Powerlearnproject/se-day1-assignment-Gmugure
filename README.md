#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering refers to the application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to develop and maintain high-quality software systems. Software engineering is important because it enables the creation of applications and systems used in various aspects such as commerce and communication.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Development of programming languages. Emphasized the use of clear logical structures therefore promoting readability and reliability.
Establishment of software engineering. Software engineering was developed leading to the systematic and disciplined approaches of developing software.
Rise of agile methodologies. Agile emphasizes collaboration and customer feedback, enabling teams to respond quickly to changes in requirements.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements. Involves gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
Design. Involves creating high-level and detailed designs of software and users.
Implementation. Involves writing the code and building software according to the design specifications.
Testing. Ensures software meets quality standards.
Deployment. At this stage, the software is released to the customers.
Maintainance. Involves supporting updating and enhancing the software to make it better.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology involves a sequential approach with distinct phases while agile methodology involves an iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change.
Waterfall methodology can be used to develop software for an aircraft. It would be appropriate here because it requires planning, documentation, and testing therefore making little room for changes.
Agile methodology can create an app for a startup and it would be appropriate because it allows room for changes and feedback.



Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer writes codes and implements software solutions.
A quality assurance engineer ensures the software quality by designing test plans.
A project manager oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of projects.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs provide tools for writing, debugging, and testing codes, for example, Visual Studio.
VCS tracks changes to source code and coordinates work among members.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing requirements
Tight deadlines
Technical debt.
The challenges can be overcome through effective communication, prioritization of tasks, regular reassessments, and agile methodologies.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing. This type of testing has individual components or modules.
Integration tests the interaction between different components.
System testing tests the entire software system
Acceptance testing tests against the user requirements to see if user needs were met.
These tests are important because they help identify and fix defects early in the development process leading to higher quality.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Refers to the process of crafting questions in a way that helps get the best responses from the robot. Prompting helps to enhance the model performance as well as improve quality through clear and concise questions.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Give me hotels I can sleep in during my vacation.
Give me 3 hotels in Zanzibar that are near the airport where I can stay in during my vacation.
The improved prompt is effective because it makes it clear to the robot what is needed concisely.
